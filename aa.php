<strong>Abstract</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;The talk is devoted to the issues of computational complexity check of various attacks on GOST 28147-89 cryptographic algorithm (commonly known as GOST). The primitives that comprise different cryptanalysis techniques and conditions of their applicability are considered in detail. The results of application of differential, algebraic, and linear cryptanalysis for different number of rounds are given. Particular attention is paid to the possibility to implement parallel cryptanalysis algorithms. As soon as possible allocations of S-box values are not defined by GOST, detection of potentially weak S-box layouts is particularly important. The talk summarizes several approaches, methods and algorithms that make it possible find out whether a particular S-box has weaknesses. The talk is concluded with relevant experimental data.</div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Cryptographic hash functions are the most widely used cryptographic algorithm. While hundreds of designs were published, until 2004 little theoretical research and cryptanalysis had been performed; moreover, about 80% of the designs was broken. The cryptanalysis of MD4, MD5 and SHA-1 by Wang et al. in 2004 created the so-called hash function crisis and formed an impetus for a large scale research effort.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">In November 2007, the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, US) announced the start of the SHA-3 competition, with as goal to select a new hash function standard. More than 60 designs were submitted from all over the world. In October 2012, the hash function Keccak was announced as the winner.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">This talk discuss the state of the art of theory and practice of hash functions and evaluates the process and outcome of the SHA-3 competition.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abstract</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Cryptographic algorithms that are considered theoretically secure can be vulnerable to attacks due to flaws in their implementations, both hardware and software. Fault and side-channel attacks or a combination of the two have been demonstrated to compromise part or all of &nbsp;the secret key in various algorithms. In this talk, these attacks will be explained and countermeasure will be discussed. It will be shown that implementation of cryptographic algorithms, in the presence of fault and side-channel attacks, requires expert knowledge. The nascent field of cryptographic engineering aims to solve not only the system requirements such as encryption speed but also potential security flaws. It will also be argued that our knowledge in fault and side-channel attacks can improve cryptographic algorithm design as well.</div>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;In this talk, we shall describe an algorithmic data-intensive approach (also referred to as Bigdata approach) approach for protecting and securing SCADA &nbsp;from attacks from malware. The approach is based on using the data used by control-system designers for making the system robust, and &nbsp;then reducing the security and protection problem of control systems or SCADA, in general, to the problem of monitoring distributed streaming data. We further show that the method is algorithmically scalable and argue that such algorithmic Bigdata approaches enable securing and protecting of IT controlled public infrastructures. complex and hence, need a wholesome approach for detection and protection. In these scenarios, apart from the classical IT security, there is a need to look at other plausible new attacks considering the domain of the physical systems and arrive at methods of protection and risk evaluation. In this paper, we shall describe an algorithmic data-intensive approach (also referred to as Bigdata approach) approach for protecting and securing SCADA &nbsp;from malware attacks. The approach is based on using the data used by control-system designers for making the system robust, and &nbsp;then reducing the security and protection problem of control systems or SCADA, in general, to the problem of monitoring distributed streaming data. We further show that the method is algorithmically scalable and argue that such algorithmic Bigdata approaches enable securing and protecting of IT controlled public infrastructures.</div>

<strong>Abstract</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Social Engineering has long been a very effective means of attacking information systems. The term knowledge worker has been coined by Peter Drucker more than 50 years ago and still describes very well the basic characteristics of many employees. Today, with current hypes such as BYOD (bring your own device) and public cloud services, young professionals expect to use the same technology both in their private life and while working. In global companies teams are no longer geographically co-located but staffed globally just-in-time. The decrease in personal interaction combined with the plethora of tools used (E-Mail, IM, Skype, Dropbox, Linked-In, Lync, etc.) create new opportunities for attackers. As recent attacks on companies such as the New York Times, RSA or Apple have shown, targeted spear-phishing attacks are an effective evolution of social engineering attacks. When combined with zero-day-exploits they become a dangerous weapon, often used by advanced persistent threats.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">In this talk we will explore some attack vectors and possible steps to mitigate the risk.</div>
